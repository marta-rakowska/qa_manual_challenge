The interface is not very user-friendly. It is difficult to find some functionalities. The dashboard page is not well organized and easy on the eyes.

The app is not intuitive. It is difficult to find some functionalities. For example, to add a new match you have to click any activity on the dashboard, click "Matches" on the sidebar menu, then click "Add match" and you are redirected to the form.

Yes. For example, when I click the "ADD REPORT" button I am redirected to the matches subpage.

### Subtask 3️⃣

*Why do we write test cases?*

ISTQB defines a test case as A set of preconditions, inputs, actions (where applicable), expected results and postconditions, developed based on test conditions.

Writing test cases is considered as one of the most important parts of software testing. It is used by the testing team, development team as well as the management. If there is no documentation for an application, we can use test case as a baseline document. (https://blog.e-zest.com/why-test-cases-are-so-important/)

The objective of writing test cases is to ensure that software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. Some of the key objectives of writing test cases,
- To verify the specific feature or functionality of the software application.
- To guide software testers in their day-to-day testing activities.
- To identify usability issues and design gaps in the software at an early stage.
- To record a catalog of steps for future reference in case of bugs.
- To provide a blueprint for upcoming projects and software testers, saving them from starting from scratch.
- To help new testers and developers quickly grasp testing, even when they join in the middle of an ongoing project. (https://testsigma.com/guides/what-is-test-case/)

### Subtask 4️⃣

## Task 3️⃣

### Subtask 1️⃣

The goal of this task was to create a bug report form.

### Subtask 2️⃣

The goal of this task was to execute tests and create bug reports.

My bug reports are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18R3WekLHHSkZMOVG58ElBaSZeMv5wBkk/view?usp=drive_link).

### Subtask 3️⃣

The goal of this task was to create a test report. 

My test report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C13cFu-YnkE8hZ971OqlNakzZ-VHBY9U/view?usp=drive_link).

## Task 4️⃣

### Subtask 1️⃣

The goal of this task was to create a bug report form for mobile testing.

My bug report form is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cll68DsHW5rWP0_kbsEOYNF1QazNGb0-/view?usp=drive_link).

### Subtask 2️⃣

The goal of this task was to perform exploratory testing of the OLX mobile app and report bugs.

You can find my bug reports [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Miaf2L4qagHtYR3dzqDrx7f9jAlCLra/view?usp=sharing).

### Subtask 3️⃣

#### *What is this app for?*

OLX is an app for buying and selling. You can get rid of unwanted items or buy something you need. You can find there both new and used things. The app offers secure payments and cheap shipping. There are also job advertisements so it can be useful if you are looking for a job or an employee.

#### *Who is the end user of this app?*

The end user of this app can be anyone regardless of age and gender. Everyone can find something interesting in this app. 

#### *Is the app user-friendly?*

In my opinion this app is user-friendly but I've been useing it for a long time and I got used to it. As far as I know, for some people "Kup z przesyłką" option is not very intuitive. 

#### *How would you improve the app? Do you have any idea for a new functionality?*

For me the greatest drawback of this app is the fact that when you sell something the advertisement is still visible in the app. People can no longer buy this item through OLX but you have to remove the advertisement manually and it is annoying when you sell more things. It would be great if there was a functionality that allows to remove an advertisement while confirming a sale.

#### *What are the differences between testing web and native applications?*

Testing web and native applications requires two completely different approaches. While testing native applications testers should pay attention to different aspects, such as battery consumption or screen resolution.
